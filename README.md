Time series is a sequence or series of data points in which the time component is involved throughout the occurrence and Analyzing this time series data with certain tools and techniques is called time series analysis.

- Easily learn about Time series analysis using 5 different algorithms
- Prediction next 10 days

Following algorithms that I have used in this project:
- Super Vector Regressor (SVR)
- Random Forest Regressor (RFR)
- K-nearest neighbour (KNN)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) + Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
